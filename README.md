# Bourbon Smash / Sass Foundations

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Bourbon Smash](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/bourbon-smash) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

In this exercise we'll be working on a pricing grid page. Our goal is take the existing styles, written in plain ole' CSS, and refactor them use Sass to make them clearer and easier to maintain.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/sass-foundations.git
    cd sass-foundations
    bin/setup

You can start the server to view the styled page with:

    bundle exec middleman server

Your goal is to refactor the application stylesheet using Sass, _without_ altering the design.

You'll want to take advantage of Sass partials, mixins, variables, loops, and everything else covered in the Sass video to clean up the provided stylesheet.

## Tips and Tricks
