# Upcase Sass Exercise

## Getting Started

To get started, just run the bin/setup command:

``` sh
$ bin/setup
```

## Working on the Exercise

Using the knowledge you learned while watching the Sass video, refactor both
the `layout.erb` and the `all.scss`. To take advantage of all that Sass magic.

Note the goal is not to alter the styling, but instead refactor the style code
for readability and maintainability using Sass.

To confirm that everything is working, be sure to run the middleman server
(`middleman s`) to confirm that the styles have not changed from a user
perspective.
